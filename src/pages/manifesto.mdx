## manifesto

you are not a user. you are not a statistic. you are a person.

picture this, a place on the internet, with your name on it. this place looks exactly the way you want it to look. a place made for other people to drop in, and get to know you. a place that truly belongs to you.

imagine a place where you could post about your interests, rant about your day, a guestbook for others to drop by and leave notes to you to read, blogs about what you're passionate about, a place to post the photos you want others to see, or the books and movies and art that inspires you.

a personal website is the answer.

it's the first step towards claiming ownership of your digital identity. if that notion excites you, read on.

### perfect websites are not the goal

the point is ownership.

in fact, imperfection is encouraged if the end result is completely authentic.

free yourself of what you think a website _should_ look like and make one that speaks to who you are. the only condition is to have a place you're proud of which is truly your own.

perfect is for web designers and people working jobs. 

just chill out and make a website you think is cool.
