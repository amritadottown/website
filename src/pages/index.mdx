## webring

what's this? a bunch of awesome Amrita students made personal websites, and we've linked all of them together through a little HTML widget.

here, try it yourself (you'll find something similar on each site): 
<div style="display: inline-flex; gap: 1rem;">
	<a href="https://amrita.town/prev">← prev</a>
	<a href="https://amrita.town/random">⚄ random</a>
	<a href="https://amrita.town/next">next →</a>
</div>

### why do this?

short answer: owning your digital land is a worthwhile goal.  
less short answer: read the [manifesto](manifesto).

### have a personal website? join us

are you an amrita student? do you have a personal website? we'd love to have you as a part of the webring.

#### is my website personal?

the best way to know is *browse the existing entries*. a webring is made for going from one website to the next. start somewhere, and use the widget on each site to go to the next one until you've seen a sufficient number. you'll definitely have a ton of fun doing this.

before you submit your website, ask yourself these questions:  

**am I going to actively maintain my website?**  
    your website should be something that others can come back to over time. you must have a commitment to continually add or update content, through writing on a blog, updating living documents, or design and technical changes.  
    this must be something you do yourself - dynamic, api-based components don't count.  

 **is my website a reflection of me?**   
    your website should be something you think represents you in a well-rounded manner. many sites in this webring go to great lengths to talk about themselves, their interests, life experiences, even just things they learned. a visitor to your website should feel as though they've made a connection with you (not the linkedin kind). we don't want portfolios.

#### how to submit

0. read everything in the previous section.
1. make sure your website has contact details somewhere, and an RSS feed if you have a blog.
2. add these links to your website - most people put it in the footer, but presentation is up to you. just make sure it's easily accessible.

    ```html
    <!-- example (you can show these 4 links however you want) -->
    <div>
        <a href="https://amrita.town">amrita.town</a>
        <a href="https://amrita.town/prev">← prev</a>
        <a href="https://amrita.town/random">⚄ random</a>
        <a href="https://amrita.town/next">next →</a>
    </div>
    ```

    **note:** if your website is not on the root path, add a `site` query parameter to each URL like this - `https://amrita.town/next?site=example.com/mypath`.

3. send a pr to add yourself to `src/members.json` on our [github](https://github.com/amritadottown/website).

we're looking forward to seeing you there.
