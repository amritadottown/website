## webring

what's this? a bunch of awesome Amrita students made personal websites, and we've linked all of them together through a little HTML widget.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1rem;">
	<span>here, try it yourself (you'll find something similar on each site): </span>
	<div style="display: inline-flex; gap: 1rem;">
		<a href="https://amrita.town/prev">← prev</a>
		<a href="https://amrita.town/random">⚄ random</a>
		<a href="https://amrita.town/next">next →</a>
	</div>
</div>

### why do this?

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap;">
	<span>short answer: owning your digital land is a worthwhile goal.&nbsp;</span>
	<span>less short answer: read the [manifesto](manifesto).</span>
