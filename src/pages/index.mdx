## webring

what's this? a bunch of awesome Amrita students made personal websites, and we've linked all of them together through a little HTML widget.

here, try it yourself (you'll find something similar on each site): 
<div style="display: inline-flex; gap: 1rem;">
	<a href="https://amrita.town/prev">← prev</a>
	<a href="https://amrita.town/random">⚄ random</a>
	<a href="https://amrita.town/next">next →</a>
</div>

### why do this?

short answer: owning your digital land is a worthwhile goal.  
less short answer: read the [manifesto](manifesto).
